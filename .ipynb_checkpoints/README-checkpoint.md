# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2

Date: 2025-3-3

Authors: Hussain Gardezi and Jeff Gielniak
Project 2 requires importing two seperate excel files and manipulating them to create four CSV files.  
The code to manipulate the data is in the 'ETL_Mini_Project_JGielniak_HGardezi.ipynb' file
The four CSVs that were generated are in the Resources folder.

Then, we created an ERD using QuickDBD and created a schema (crowdfunding_db_schema.sql).  A screenshot of the 
ERD is called 'Crowdfunding ERD.png' in our submission as well.

We uploaded that schema to SQL, and queried all the tables.  Screenshots of those queries are in the 'Table Screenshots' folder
